# Wordle Solver

Author: Dhruv Iyer



To run, make sure to unzip `words.zip` into `words.txt`.

To see the program select a word and then try and guess the solution do

```shell
python3 engine.py
```

Or to use this program to solve a wordle, do

```shell
python3 solver.py
```

The code will give you a guess to enter into a wordle app of your choice. When you get the results, use 'b' to represent black/grey letters, 'y' to represent yellow letters, and 'g' to represent green letters. Space-separate the inputs.

Example result: p (grey) o (grey) i (grey) s (yellow) e (green)

Your input: b b b y g
